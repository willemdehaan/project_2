        Persuasive or Deceptive Visualization?

      <h2>Proposition: <small>Policing practices often reflect deeper systemic inequalities, with communities of color disproportionately affected by enforcement patterns rooted in historical bias. By examining complaint data, these visualizations aim to expose how racial disparities persist, and how data can both reveal and obscure the reality of over-policing in minority neighborhoods</small></h2>

        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="images\bad_cop_FINAL.png" alt="Heat Map of New York City showing precincts with the most complaints correlate to the neighborhoods with the most concentrated African American population" width = "959" height = "511" />
          <figcaption>Heat Map of New York City showing the relationship between number of complaints and African American population</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Redundant Coloring (-1): Using the same colormap across both heatmaps suggests a direct equivalence between the two variables measured. While it helps the viewer visually compare the maps, it reinforces correlations which misleadingly implies the constructs are linked.</li>
          <li>Normalized Color Bins (-2): By normalizing both variables to percentiles and applying the same color bin thresholds the maps appear mmore directly comparable. The choice enhances the persuasive nature, but masks the raw scale differences, in our case counts versus percentages.</li>
          <li>Map of NYC (+1): Utilizing the spatial boundaries of New York City allows the viewer to meaningfully tie the statistics to local areas. The geographic areas, neighborhoods and precincts, makes for a persuasive frame without misconstruing data.</li>

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

          <img src="images\good_cop_FINAL.png" alt="Line Plot showing that complaints lodged by African Americans against the NYPD have descreased over time from 2016-2020" width = "692" height = "301"/>
          <figcaption>Line plot showing the number of complaints lodged by African Americans against the NYPD decrease from 2016 to 2020</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Filtering for Only African American Complaints (-1): Focusing solely on complaints lodged by African Americans allows for the experience of a particular community to be told. However, purpsefully omitting complaints from other groups masks the overall scale of misconduct, while also exxagerating the decline in complaints.</li>
          <li>Limiting the Timeframe (-2): Restricting the timeframe to a five year window starting in 2016 allows for the downward trend to appear more significant. By focusing on this reduction the graph lacks historical context, and the line plot does not communicate the significance events of this period, for example the pandemic in 2019.</li>
          <li>Plotting Raw Complaints (0): Using absolute complaints, while showing the true population behavior, does not account for shifts in the population or reporting fatigue.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>After digging into data on police complaints, I became especially interested in how policing impacts communities of color. The way communities are policed is often a reflection of deeper systemic forces. The country’s historical treatment of minorities still shows up today in the form of inequality, including in interactions with law enforcement. It’s crucial to better understand these disparities, because when situations are misjudged due to underlying stereotypes, the consequences can be grave.
            Using my understanding I had a clear idea of how I wanted my visualization to look FOR my proposition. I knew I wanted to create a heat map to visualizae which areas may be “over policed”, and how that coincides with the demographic of those who live there. To achieve this I had to acquire outside data for New York City’s ethnicity by region, and region mappings to create the visualization. Upon obtaining these datasets I merged them appropriately, and used the plotly library to create a side by side visualization so as to easily compare my variables of focus, complaint counts and African American population. The initial visualization was persuasive, but to take it further I applied the same color map to allow the viewer to more easily draw a connection between what was being mapped. Finally, to add to the “deception”, I normalized the color scales to make the heatmaps more similar, and to make the variables more comparable.
            However, creating a visualization AGAINST my proposition proved more difficult for me. I used my exploratory data analysis to my advantage, as I had noticed the number of complaints fell from 2019 to 2020. I used the focus of my previous visualization, and I filtered my dataset for complaints that had been lodged by African Americans. These data points exaggerated the decline I previously saw, as well as pushed a narrative that minorities were the victims of less over policing. Finally, I restricted the timeframe of my line plot as to increase the significance of the decline in complaints from 2019 to 2020.
            This project definitely challenged my understanding of ethical analysis and visualzation. In both instances I was initially earnest in my visualization, and utilized deceptive techniques to create more persuasive visualizations. More importantly, I noticed how much easier it was to be deceptive when it came to creating a visualization that fit my narrative. Through this project I have come to understand the editorial nature of data presentation. Not all persuasive design is misleading, but it becomes ethically ambiguous when choices are made to conceal the contextualization of data and present it in a way that overstates certainty. To draw these boundaries requires self-scrutiny, and a constant willingness to be transparent with assumptions and to be criticalwhen transforming data.
